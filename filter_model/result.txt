🔸 After all BTC is mined, the only way to acquire it is to provide a valuable good or #service to someone who already has it.


🔸 In relative terms, #Bitcoin should have no #inflation by the end of the decade.

#FridayFinance@peej_marlowe Yes, it is exactly like that. 

Only there is no physical mining and you could equally have done it from your bedroom yourself whilst sat in your underpants. 

Yes, thin air, just like every other cryptocurrency.1: #Bitcoin is not fungible.

2: Centralized mining by few pools.
Global currency will be very dangerous in hands of few individuals as they can completely blacklist/refuse to mine any transaction.

@Blockchain_CBC #cryptocurrencyDue to my research #Bitcoin is not done yet before next halving. Let me explain why:

- Miners have sold $BTC heavily at both All-Time Highs to cover their maintenance costs

- Current costs to mine 1 #BTC is around $30k (local bottom)

- #BTC did not have a blow-off top🐳 Whales Don't Lose Faith

The $BTC rate continues to decline, and now the #cryptocurrency is valued at $40K. But this does not deter large investors who continue to buy #bitcoin. Transactions worth more than 30 thousand BTC were seen.

(Inspired by multiples speeches from @maxkeiser and @jackmallers about false directions in our crypto 🌎 that distract the general public from #Bitcoin ) https://t.co/KkkSWX5nnoImo, has been over for at least a year, people just don’t realize it.  Lots of investments marked at all time highs after series of up rounds that have little value outside the small groups marking.  As a “liquid analogy”, XRP, has never been possible to sell even 5% at market.FIS to launch #Bitcoin and crypto trading. 🚀📢 Hey @cryptocom @cronos_chain fans!

Started researching Bitcoin’s energy consumption in 2016. Launched the index in 2017. Had my first academic publication in 2018. Got employed by DNB in 2020. Shocking. 🤷‍♂️Some inside baseball: 
@TheBitcoinConf cost us $30m+ to produce. That’s effectively a Series C funding round spent over 4 days 🤯🤮. We were def ripped off on some things, but w/o our team’s creative problem solving we could have easily spent $50m… some lessons worth sharing:#Bitcoin ETFs are now up and running in Canada, Germany, Brazil, Singapore and now even Australia.

And it is a horrible horrible idea to celebrate that.
